To set up and run your Vite-powered React project with Material-UI locally, follow these steps:

Install Project Dependencies:

Open your terminal and navigate to your project's root directory.
    Run: npm install
This command installs all the necessary packages listed in your package.json file.
Install Material-UI Components and Icons:

To add Material-UI to your project,
    execute: npm install @mui/material @emotion/react @emotion/styled
This installs the core Material-UI components along with Emotion, which is used for styling.

For Material-UI icons, 
    run: npm install @mui/icons-material
This adds the Material-UI icons to your project.

Start the Development Server:
Once all dependencies are installed, start the development server with:

  npm run dev

This will launch your Vite development server, and you can view your project in the browser.
Ensure you have Node.js and npm installed on your system before executing these commands.
